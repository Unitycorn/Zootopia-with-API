# The Zootopia project now powered by API üöÄ

Like in the previous version, we gather information about animals, serialize the data and putting them into an HTML template and generating a new combined file.

My API key for the animal data request has been placed in an .env file for security purposes.

## Installation üíª

To install this project, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies in requirements.txt using `pip` or `pip3`respectively.

You will also need your own API key from [api-ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com).

## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è

To use this project, run the following command - `python animals_web_generator.py`.

Enter the animal you like and select the skin type (a list of available skin types will be provided).

The program will generate an HTML file which you can open in any webbrowser.
